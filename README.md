1.Classificaton problems:

Problem-
 Analyzing the written works of 2 different authors and using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to classify an additional work by each author. The four works from each author as the initial data vectors, and the 5th work from each to test the classification algorithm
 
Data Cleaning -  Inside the zip file, The fileConvert.py and dataClean.py remove the unwanted text from the input file

Data Analyzing - In AuthorKnn.ipynb file, data analysis is finding the common word among the authors to identify the unknown author. 
The Author Classification is performed using the KNN algorithm.

The Authors zip file includes the pandas' file and CSV files. The AuthorKnn.ipynb file has a description of the workflow.

# Data conversion :
Problem-
 the text file is analyzed to convert to the CSV file.

The Data clean zip has the text file and .csv files. This work is primarily focusing on the data conversion part. The output looks like the file in the expected result folder.
