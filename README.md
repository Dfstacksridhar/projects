1.Classificaton

Problem-
 Analyzing the written works of 2 different authors and using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to classify an additional work by each author.The  4 works from each author as the initial data vectors, and a 5th work from each to test the classification algorithm
 
Data Cleaning:Inside the zip file ,The fileConvert.py and dataClean.py removes the unwanted text from the input file

Data Analyzing: In the AuthorKnn.ipynb file , the data analyzing part is performed to find the comman word among the authors to identify the unknown author.Classification is done using the KNN algorithm .

The Authors zip has the pandas file and some of the csv file. The projects is basically the classification problem.The workflow is mentioned in the AuthorKnn.ipynb file.

# Data convertion works
Problem-
 

The Data clean zip has the text file and .csv files. This work is primarly focused on data cleaning part where the text file is converted to the desired csv file.
